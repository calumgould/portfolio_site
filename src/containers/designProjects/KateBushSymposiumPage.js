                Full brand identity for the Kate Bush Symposium, to be held in Edinburgh on 12th December 2019 at Edinburgh College of Art.

                The visuals are designed to appeal to Kate Bush's followers, using her iconic expressions in an abstracted, half-tone form to create a subtle background, still recognisable as Kate Bush even though heavily cropped, showing how iconic her features are.
                <br /><br />
                The imagery in combination with bold, vibrant text makes the post pop out to readers, and bringing a simple but effective colour palette and style that can be used across the rest of the event branding.

                The proposal was initially made during my time at Cosmic Collective, a student led design agency, which I ran with Lynn Jiang. After winning the pitch from all agencies, this project was continued after my graduation as freelance work.
