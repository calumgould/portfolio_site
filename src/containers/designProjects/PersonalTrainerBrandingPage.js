                Logo, business card and social media branding design for Clara Nimmo. A personal trainer based at Pure Gym Quartermile, Edinburgh.
                <br /><br />
                Clara's previous business card was very dated and she wanted a modern, vibrant revamp of her personal branding, to tie in with a new Instagram account that she was planning on creating.
                <br /><br />
                Using reference sketches that Clara provided for what she envisioned for the branding. I designed the business card and social media icons & templates that she could use to help structure posts and keep the visuals consistent with her branding for any content.
