                Garvald Artists is one of 21 supported workshops in Edinburgh. Their purpose is to support adults with a learning disability and develop their art, craft and catering skills.
                <br /><br />
                Proposed design for how artists at Garvald could introduce their work to the art and design world.
                <br /><br />
                Working in a two person team, we overhauled the current Garvald Artists website, to have a more creative feel, featuring work by the artists themselves. Collating all the proposed changes in a concise publication to give to the client.
                <br /><br />
                The inclusion of an online shop in the website gives the artists the tools to begin to sell their work through a commercial medium, showing examples of how their art could be implemented on different products.
