                Brand redesign concept for Loganair, Scotland's biggest airline est 1962.
                <br /><br />
                A fresh, modern take on the Loganair brand, with the aim of bringing it up to standard with major airlines across the UK.
                <br /><br />
                This new design would allow the airline to branch outside of Scotland by removing the overly tartan aesthetic and instead taking the existing colour palette to create a whole new identity, without straying too far from the core brand.
                <br /><br />
                This included concepts for aeroplane livery, tickets, advertisements, billboards, uniforms, tickets, pillows and stationary.
