                A-Level Graphic Design project to redesign and illustrate a children's book.
                <br /><br />
                Using my childhood favourite book, "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" as a template to dictate structure and content. I redesigned the entire book and all its elements, whilst still keeping a familiar feel to the classic.
                <br /><br />
                Collage was used to create the fruit, shapes and trees. Pastels were used to create the night sky background.    A combination of sand and watercolour were used to create the dirt textures. Crumpled and torn paper were used to build the background elements and text layers.
